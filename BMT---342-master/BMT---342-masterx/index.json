Welcome to the show, Doctor Baker. Dr Baker: Thank you. It’s great to be here. Let’s start with tip one. Don’t go to bed with the television on. Some people think they can sleep well with the TV on, but the noise and lights mean you don’t really sleep well, so turn it off! Tip two: Don’t think too much before bedtime. Do your hardest homework earlier in the evening. Do easier homework later. If your brain is too busy and full of ideas it takes longer to get to sleep. Tip three: Don’t play video games for an hour before you go to sleep. They also make your brain too busy and active. Tip four: Turn off your cell phone when you go to bed. What is so important that it can’t wait until the morning? If possible, leave your phone in another room. Tip five: Play music if you like. But don’t play it too loud. Turn the sound down low. Host: Thank you, Doctor. That is very useful advice for our young listeners",

A clear desk. My desk isn’t clear. There are lots of papers and books and pens on it. Katy: Well, that isn’t very good! Ben: What’s tip number three? Katy: Have lots of breaks. I always study for thirty minutes. Then I have a break for five minutes. I move my arms and legs and drink some water. Then I study again for thirty minutes. Ben: I never have a break. I sometimes study for two or three hours.  Katy: That isn’t a good idea! It’s important to get up and move your body. Ben: OK. Thanks. Next time I think I can get good marks!",

      "aciklama": "Morning, everyone. Quiet, please. Right, OK. So, today I’m going to give you some advice to help you prepare for the exams next week. So, make some notes as I’m talking, please. Everybody ready? Now, while you’re studying, eat food that gives you energy. Don’t be tempted to eat sweets or drink cola. Sugar won’t help you study but fruit and cereals will. Apples, actually, are especially good. Find a comfortable place with plenty of light when you study. But not ‘too’ comfortable or you’ll fall asleep! Try and keep a positive mind. It is easier to study when you are positive and relaxed. Now, if you start feeling anxious, have a little break. Go out for a stroll around the block. Don’t try to learn everything. There isn’t time. Just choose the ‘important’ things, the things that’ll get you the most points in an exam. And if you aren’t sure about this, ask me. First, learn the main ideas and don’t worry too much about the details. If you have time, you can come back later and read the details. Make notes of these key points and read them, then cover them up and try to remember all the points. Now, it might be boring, but repetition helps you to remember. Use past exam papers to study. They will help you understand what kind of questions come up. There are plenty of past exam papers in the library. You can photocopy them and take them home. Take regular breaks while you’re studying. A five-minute break every half hour is usually enough. Get some fresh air and stretch your arms and legs. Drink a glass of water too. It’s important to keep hydrated. And, last but not least, good luck! I’m sure you’ll all do your best.",
